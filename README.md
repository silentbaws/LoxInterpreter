# Lox Scripting Language

This repository won't have anything unique and the code is entirely from the "Crafting Interpreters" book by Robert Nystrom. However, there may be various `TODO` comments that capture my thoughts as I'm reading the book and plan to tackle in a different project after completion.

## Intro/Overview and Goals

This is my first foray into the world of compilers and interpreters but I'm hopeful it won't be my last. The goal of this is to jumpstart my knowledge before diving deeper and working on a language of my own.

## Structure

This repo will contain unique Java projects for each chapter appropriately named `Chapter1/`, `Chapter2/`, etc. All of the projects are built with Java17 and Maven.

The source code of each project will be the entirety of chapter it's named after, including any end of chapter challenges I attempt.
